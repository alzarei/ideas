   - **"Ollama not running"**: Look for Ollama in your system tray and start it
   - **"Browser doesn't open"**: Manually go to http://localhost:8000
   - **"Setup failed"**: Run `setup.py` again

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Best Experience

### Getting Better Responses
- **Be specific**: Instead of "help me code", say "help me write a Python function to sort a list"
- **Provide context**: Give the AI background information about what you're trying to do
- **Ask follow-ups**: You can continue the conversation - the AI remembers what you talked about

### Managing Conversations
- **Organize by topic**: Start new conversations for different subjects
- **Name your chats**: Click on conversation titles to rename them
- **Delete old chats**: Right-click to remove conversations you don't need

### Performance Tips
- **Close other programs**: AI uses computer resources, so close unnecessary apps
- **Use smaller models**: If it's slow, try Gemma 2B or Llama 3.2 1B
- **Restart occasionally**: If it gets slow, restart the app

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### "The app won't start"
1. Make sure you completed the one-time setup
2. Check that Ollama is running (look in system tray)
3. Try running `verify.py` to check what's missing

### "AI responses are slow"
- This is normal! AI thinking takes time
- Try a smaller model like Gemma 2B
- Close other programs to free up computer resources

### "I can't access the website"
- Make sure the app is running (black terminal window should be open)
- Try going to http://localhost:8000 manually
- Check if another program is using port 8000

### "Models aren't downloading"
1. Make sure you have internet connection
2. Check that Ollama is installed and running
3. Manually run: `ollama pull llama3.2:3b`

### "Everything is broken"
**Nuclear option** - Start fresh:
1. Delete the project folder
2. Download it again
3. Run setup again
