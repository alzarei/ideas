fix: completely overhaul one-click setup script to resolve critical installation issues

- Fix infinite download loops in winget installations with timeout protection
- Add PATH environment refresh to detect newly installed programs (especially Ollama)
- Implement proper Python executable detection to avoid Microsoft Store aliases
- Remove admin permission prompts by integrating all setup steps into single script
- Add robust version checking for Ollama with fallback detection methods
- Eliminate separate PowerShell processes that caused permission loops
- Add silent installation flags for fully automated setup
- Implement graceful error handling and diagnostic messaging

The setup script now works completely automatically without user intervention,
successfully installing dependencies and launching the On-Device LLM Assistant.

Resolves issues with:
- Python/Ollama detection failures
- Infinite winget download loops  
- Permission prompt loops
- PATH environment synchronization
- Microsoft Store Python alias conflicts
